# Wi-Fi Speed Test App
This is a PyQt5 application that allows users to test their Wi-Fi speed, latency and signal strength. The app displays the download and upload speed, latency and signal strength in real-time as the test is running. Users can save the results of the test to a file in text format.

## Installation
To use the app, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You also need to `install PyQt5` and speedtest modules. You can install these modules by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 speedtest-cli
```
## Usage
To run the app, navigate to the directory where the code is saved and run the following command:

```bash
python speed_test_app.py
``` 
The app will start running and you will see the interface where you can start the speed test.
